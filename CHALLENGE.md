Challenge for the job opening Frontend Engineer 
This challenge is meant to test your capability in programming modern day applications. The result of your work is then 
presented by you during the following interview.  
We want you to build a frontend for the GitHub GraphQL API. The frontend should allow to browse the issues of a GitHub 
repository, specifically of the official React repository. You will build a react app which allows to search for a text term in either 
the body or title of the issues as well as for the status OPEN or CLOSED. After listing these issues, a user should be able to 
view a single issue and all the comments.  
Your application should be able to handle wrong input by the user or any unusual behavior (e.g. handling errors from API or 
404 page). 
For this scenario we expect you to deliver a high-quality application. Your code should be typed using TypeScript and the 
implementation should be based on React with a sensible routing strategy and structured state management of your choice.  
For this challenge we expect you to use the following technologies: 
• React  
• TypeScript  
• Apollo / GraphQL 
Most important for us is to understand how you tackle complex problems. Therefore, please finish this challenge as far as 
possible under the given technological requirements. A correct and understandable partial implementation is more important 
than a complete one. 
The assignment will be presented in a live demo as part of the personal interview. 
Nice to have: 
• Pagination for search results and comments 
• Styled-components 
• Testing of important aspects of the application
